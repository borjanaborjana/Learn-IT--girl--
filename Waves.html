		 <p>"Dear stranded person. Through no fault of your own, or perhaps quite the opposite, <br>
		     you have found yourself in a truly unpleasant situation - alone on a deserted piece of <br>
             land, surrounded by an ocean. Unless you happen to be Robinson Crusoe, or one of the blond <br>
			 siblings from <i>Blue Lagoon</i>, I suggest you take this opportunity to get off this island.<br>
